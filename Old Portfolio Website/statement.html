    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>Art is <em>the best.</em> When someone asks me why I make art, I ask them: <strong>WHY NOT.</strong> </p>
      <p>For my first project, I decided to make a video with the concepts involving dreams and nightmares. The materials I used was my 
         photography camera, my phone, and my laptop. Half of my video was filmed on my camera and the other half was filmed on my phone.
         I filmed both during the day and at night, and I used music from a free sound sharing website to include in my video in order to 
         enhance it for the viewers. For my video process, I decided to edit it all on Premiere with video transitions to make it look
         more smooth and clean. I had to edit my clips around and place them in a certain order so that my video will relate to my concept.
