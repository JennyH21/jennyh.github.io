    <center><font color="red"><h1>It all began with the doll.</h1></font></center>
    <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>On Christmas day, Lily was given a present from her grandmother. Wrapped in
      an old, christmas wrapping paper decorated with christmas trees and ornaments,
      the box contained a teddy bear-sized doll holding a letter.</p></font></font></center>

      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Looking at the doll, her clothes were old and torn, the color from her cheeks
        faded, and those gleaming eyes were lifeless. Slumped against the walls of the box, the doll looked ominous and creepy.
        Its eyes stared back at her, waiting for Lily to touch her.</p></font></font></center>

        <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Displeased, Lily felt that she was too old for dolls, especially old ones
          that smelled of her grandmother. Without taking another peek, she sealed the box and stored it in the very back of her
          closet so that she would never have to see it again.</p></font></font></center>

          <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>At first, everything felt normal. But suddenly, she began to hear footsteps
            and a child’s laugh echo throughout the house.</p></font></font></center>

            <audio controls><source src="creepychildlaughwithfootsteps.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>

            <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Shaken, Lily carefully searched the house for the source of the laughter
              but found nothing.</p></font></font></center>

              <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>“Do not worry Lily. It is nothing. It must be your own imagination.
                Maybe it was just a group of children passing by the house. Yes, that should be it,” she thought to herself.
                </p></font></font></center>

                <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Days passed and nothing happened.</p></font></font></center>

                <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>One day she opened her closet to find that the doll was missing.
                  Searching around, she  found her in the abandoned attic full of family heirlooms, antiques, and forgotten toys.
                </p></font></font></center>

                <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>She found that to be odd but thought nothing of it. Maybe she had
                  placed it there one random day.</p></font></font></center>

                  <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Slowly, more creepy things started to happened; the furniture was
                    moved every day and her things were constantly misplaced. Coming to the conclusion that the doll could be
                    haunted, she decides to go visit her grandmother to return the doll.</p></font></font></center>

                    <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>She goes to her grandmother’s house and knocks on her door to be
                      greeted with no answer. She turns the doorknob to find the door unlocked and enters her grandmother’s house.
                      </p></font></font></center>

                      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>“Grandma? Are you there? Anyone home?”</p></font></font></center>

                      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Silence.</p></font></font></center>

                      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Walking around the house, she explored every room and called
                        out to her grandmother. She went upstairs and found her grandmother, dead on her bathroom floor.
                      </p></font></font></center>

                      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>After her grandmother’s funeral, Lily is still stuck with the
                        doll, never given the chance to ask her grandmother about it. Gradually, more paranormal things start to
                        happen in her house and it progressively gets worse.</p></font></font></center>

                        <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Door slams, creaky floors, scratches through the walls, voices…
                          </p></font></font></center>

                          <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>She decides to throw the doll away, believing that everything
                            paranormal is linked to the doll; she just wants her life to be normal again.</p></font></font></center>

                            <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Late one night, she was webcamming with her friend when
                              the lights suddenly went out in her house. She decides to check it out and noticed that her front door
                              was open.</p></font></font></center>

                              <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>After closing and locking the door, she decides to go
                                to the kitchen and arm herself with a knife for protection. When she entered the kitchen, all of her
                                drawers were opened and pulled out.</p></font></font></center>

                                <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Scared, she races back to her room and told her friend
                                  what happened. Her friend had a scared look on her face and told Lily to turn around.
                                </p></font></font></center>

                                <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>As soon as she did, she sees the doll behind her.
                                  </p></font></font></center>

                                  <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>The End (?)</p></font></font></center>
