      an old, christmas wrapping paper decorated with christmas trees and ornaments,
      the box contained a teddy bear-sized doll holding a letter.</p></font></font></center>
      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Looking at the doll, her clothes were old and torn, the color from her cheeks faded, and those gleaming eyes were
        lifeless. Slumped against the walls of the box, the doll looked ominous and creepy. Its eyes stared back at her,
        waiting for Lily to touch her.</p></font></font></center>
