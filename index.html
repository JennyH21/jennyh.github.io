    <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>On Christmas day, Lily was given a present from her grandmother. Wrapped in
      an old, christmas wrapping paper decorated with christmas trees and ornaments,
      the box contained a teddy bear-sized doll holding a letter.</p></font></font></center>

      <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Looking at the doll, her clothes were old and torn, the color from her cheeks
        faded, and those gleaming eyes were lifeless. Slumped against the walls of the box, the doll looked ominous and creepy.
        Its eyes stared back at her, waiting for Lily to touch her.</p></font></font></center>

        <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Displeased, Lily felt that she was too old for dolls, especially old ones that
          smelled of her grandmother. Without taking another peek, she sealed the box and stored it in the very back of her closet
          so that she would never have to see it again.</p></font></font></center>

          <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>At first, everything felt normal. But suddenly, she began to hear footsteps
            and a child’s laugh echo throughout the house.</p></font></font></center>

            <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>Shaken, Lily carefully searched the house for the source of the laughter
              but found nothing.</p></font></font></center>
              
              <center><font color="white"><font size="+3"><p>“Do not worry Lily. It is nothing. It must be your own imagination.
                Maybe it was just a group of children passing by the house. Yes, that should be it,” she thought to herself.
